This repository is an attempt to recreate the original 2011 Retro Engine Sonic CD code as closely as possible.

Since it tries to be a clone rather than a compatible recreation, you absolutely should not use this code for anything other than unofficial ports of the game. Do not bundle it with game data.

You can learn from it and change it, but don't try to use it for developing a new project.
